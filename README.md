# SSBump
This repository contains the codes and documentation for our paper titled "Intelligent Traffic Control with Smart Speed Bumps", which is currently under review at one of the IEEE international IoT conferences in 2023.

## Overview

This paper proposes a novel Internet of Things-based system called Smart Speed Bump (SSBump) to improve traffic management, optimize emergency vehicle response times, and enhance the overall driving experience in smart cities.

The key components of the system include:

- Speed bumps embedded with sensors and actuators
- Communication modules (WiFi and LoRa)
- Cloud-based data processing and analytics
- Integration of non-Newtonian fluids into speed bump design

## Implementation

Our team developed a prototype of the SSBump system using Arduino and various hardware components. The codes for the prototype are provided in this repository.

The prototype demonstrates real-time communication between an emergency vehicle and a speed bump to temporarily deflate the bump when the vehicle approaches. This enables reduced response times for emergency services.

We also conducted simulations to analyze the SSBump's effectiveness in minimizing traffic delays compared to conventional speed bumps.
